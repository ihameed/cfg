some debian guy hacked up the xterm entry for upstream ncurses to use kbs=^?
instead of kbs=^H. most linux distributions use this change. nixos doesn't, and
neither does void linux prior to 2023-05-19. openbsd also uses kbs=^? for xterm
and also screen. freebsd uses termcamp. it uses kb=^H for xterm and screen. it
also uses ^H for tmux, which is wrong, because tmux-the-program always emits ^?
